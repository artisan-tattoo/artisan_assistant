slug: "shipit"

I haven't written an update in a while, and part of that is because I have been
doing other things than just AA. Part of the craft of software projects is
knowing when you can cut corners, and how to do so. 

In AA's case, one of Artisan's artists has a show this weekend, and they would
_really_ like to be able to use AA to collect their customer's info. So, I'm
going to focus on the bare minimum to get them up and going, and hopefully
ship that this evening. This means I don't really have time to do things like
recap the last few days of development.

However, I _am_ still writing relatively large commit messages, with my
justifications. They're getting a bit smaller, but there's also way less
interesting things in them.

I've also [tasked everything
out](https://github.com/artisan-tattoo/artisan_assistant/issues) in Issues, so
that I can make sure I take care of everything.

Hopefully, the next notebook you'll read is about a successful first weekend
of use!
